The provided code implements a hash-based Set data structure in C, ensuring unique storage of values. It consists of two files: set.h (header file) and set.c (implementation file).  Overview: This Set structure is a hash table-based container that prevents duplicate entries. It supports basic operations such as insertion, deletion, lookup, and iteration. The set dynamically resizes itself using a list of prime numbers to maintain efficiency.  Key Features: Creation & Deletion:  set_new() initializes a new set with user-defined hashing and equality functions. set_free() deallocates all allocated memory. Insertion & Removal:  set_insert() adds a new element while checking for duplicates. set_remove() deletes an element if present. The set resizes dynamically when needed. Lookup & Iteration:  set_query() checks if an element exists in the set. set_iterate(), set_iter_next(), and set_iter_has_more() allow iteration over elements. Set Operations:  set_union() merges two sets. set_intersection() finds common elements between two sets. set_to_array() converts the set contents into an array. Implementation: The set uses chaining for collision handling, where elements are stored in linked lists inside the hash table. A user-specified hash function determines storage locations, and a comparison function ensures uniqueness.  Overall, this implementation provides a lightweight and efficient way to handle unique collections of values with fast lookups, insertions, and deletions.
