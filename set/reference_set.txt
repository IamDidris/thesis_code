The set.c & set.h file feature an implemetation of the hash-based set data structure written in C. 
The set is a data structure stores a collection of values, but each value is unique and the set 
thus has no duplicate entries. The program features a wide range of functionality for creating
new sets, insertion of values, deletion of values, and searching for values. 
The program is also able to iterate over all values in the set, or find the number of entries 
in a set. 
The program also features two unique functions where the user can combine two sets, producing
the union of those two sets, or generate a set based on the intersection between two sets.
