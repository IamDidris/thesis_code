The provided code implements the A (A-Star) pathfinding algorithm*, which is commonly used for finding the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. It is structured in a modular way, allowing flexibility in how nodes, costs, and heuristics are defined.

How It Works:
Data Structures:

The code defines several key structures, including VisitedNodes (which keeps track of visited nodes), NodeRecord (which stores information about each node), and ASPath (which stores the final path).
The ASNeighborList structure is used to hold neighboring nodes and their respective costs.
Pathfinding Process:

The function ASPathCreate() initializes the algorithm by creating a visited node list and a neighbor list.
The start node is added to an open set, and its estimated cost to the goal is calculated using the provided heuristic function.
The algorithm iteratively picks the node with the lowest cost, evaluates its neighbors, and updates their costs if a shorter path is found.
Nodes are either added to the open set (to be explored later) or moved to the closed set (finalized).
Heuristics and Comparisons:

The algorithm relies on a heuristic function (pathCostHeuristic) to estimate the cost from a given node to the goal.
A comparator function (nodeComparator) allows for flexible node comparisons.
Result Handling:

If the goal is reached, the shortest path is reconstructed and stored in an ASPath object.
Utility functions (ASPathGetCost, ASPathGetCount, ASPathGetNode) allow access to the final path.
Overall, this implementation provides an efficient and customizable A* pathfinding solution.
