The provided code implements the A (A-Star) pathfinding algorithm* in C. A* is a widely used search algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph, commonly used in applications like game AI and robotics.  The AStar.c file contains the core implementation of the algorithm, including:  Node and Path Structures: Defines structures for nodes, paths, and lists of neighbors. Visited Nodes Management: Keeps track of nodes that have been visited during the search. Open and Closed Sets: Uses a priority queue (min-heap) to manage nodes that are being explored. Cost Calculation: Computes both actual and estimated costs (heuristic) to determine the best path. Path Construction: Once the goal node is reached, it reconstructs the optimal path. The AStar.h file provides the interface for the algorithm, defining:  Function Prototypes: For creating paths (ASPathCreate), retrieving path details (ASPathGetCost, ASPathGetCount), and destroying paths (ASPathDestroy). Customizable Callbacks: Allows users to define how neighbors are retrieved, how costs are estimated, and how nodes are compared. The algorithm follows the A strategy*, iterating through nodes while maintaining an efficient priority queue. It uses a heuristic function (if provided) to speed up search efficiency. The implementation is memory-efficient and designed for flexibility, allowing users to apply it to various types of graphs.  This implementation is efficient and modular, making it suitable for a variety of applications requiring shortest path computation.
