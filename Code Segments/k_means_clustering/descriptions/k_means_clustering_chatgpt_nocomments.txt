The provided C program implements the K-Means Clustering Algorithm and visualizes the results using EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) output.  The program clusters a large number of randomly generated 2D points into a specified number of clusters (k) and then outputs the clusters graphically.   How It Works: Data Representation:   The program defines two structures: observation (representing a data point with x, y coordinates and a group ID) and  cluster (representing cluster centroids with x, y coordinates and the count of assigned points).  Clustering Process:  The kMeans function initializes clusters by randomly assigning points to groups.  It iteratively updates cluster centroids by averaging the positions of assigned points.  The nearest cluster for each point is recalculated, and the process repeats until changes in assignments become minimal.  Visualization:  The printEPS function generates a graphical EPS representation of the clusters.  It determines bounding box coordinates, assigns colors to clusters, and plots both the data points and cluster centroids.  Testing:  The test and test2 functions generate synthetic data in a circular distribution.  The program runs kMeans on large datasets (100,000 and 1,000,000 points) with different cluster counts (k=5 and k=11).  Execution: The main function initializes randomization and calls test() to run the clustering and visualization.  This program efficiently clusters large datasets and provides a visual representation of the results using PostScript.
