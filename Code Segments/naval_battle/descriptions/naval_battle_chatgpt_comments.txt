The code implements a simplified version of the classic naval battle (or Battleship) game using standard C libraries. It provides functions to validate user input and determine if boat placements are legal on a 10×10 board. The initial function checks if the selected row and column fall within valid ranges. Another function then evaluates whether a boat of a given size can be placed starting from a specified location in either a horizontal or vertical orientation, ensuring that the boat fits within board boundaries and does not overlap with existing placements.  Additionally, the code is structured with appropriate documentation comments, including brief descriptions and parameter explanations, to help understand the purpose of each function. The logic uses simple control structures like conditionals and loops to iterate over board positions and count available spots for boat placement. Overall, it lays the groundwork for managing boat placements and checking user input validity, key components of the game’s setup phase. This approach is straightforward and relies solely on standard input/output functions, making it accessible and easy to understand while maintaining clear separation between input validation and game logic.
