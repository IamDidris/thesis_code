The provided code files collectively implement a modular filter bank channelizer and OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) transceiver framework, designed for use in digital communication systems, especially within the LiquidDSP library.  FIRPFBCH Modules: Files such as firpfbch.proto.c, firpfbch_cccf.c, firpfbch_crcf.c, firpfbch2.proto.c, and firpfbchr.proto.c define various versions of polyphase filter banks. These are used for efficient channelization (splitting a wideband signal into narrow subchannels) and synthesis (combining narrow subchannels into a wideband signal). The modules support both analyzer (receiver) and synthesizer (transmitter) modes. Filters are constructed using Kaiser or raised-cosine windows, and operations like FFT/IFFT are employed for fast convolution. Specialized variants like firpfbch2 and firpfbchr optimize performance for specific cases like even-numbered channels or decimation.  OFDM Modules: Files such as ofdmframe.common.c, ofdmframegen.c, and ofdmframesync.c implement the transmission and reception of OFDM frames. ofdmframegen constructs OFDM symbols with configurable pilot/data/null subcarriers, cyclic prefixes, and window tapering. ofdmframesync handles synchronization at the receiver by detecting preambles (S0/S1), estimating timing/frequency offsets, equalization, and invoking a callback with demodulated data. These modules rely on pre-defined training sequences and FFT-based modulation/demodulation.  In essence, this code enables flexible, high-performance multichannel communication through combined use of filter banks and OFDM techniques, commonly applied in software-defined radios.
