These files provide key functions for multi-channel filtering and OFDM-based signal processing in a software-defined radio environment. The firpfbch family (firpfbch.proto.c, firpfbch_cccf.c, firpfbch_crcf.c)  implements polyphase filterbank channelizers (FIRPFBCH), splitting an input into multiple channels or combining  multiple channels into one. Variations like firpfbch2.proto.c offer half-sized block processing,  while firpfbchr.proto.c supports rational decimation. For OFDM, ofdmframe.common.c provides helper routines and  subcarrier management, ofdmframegen.c handles frame generation (pilot placement, training sequences, and IFFT  operations), and ofdmframesync.c manages synchronization, channel estimation, and demodulation (detecting S0/S1,  applying FFT, correcting offsets). Finally, reference_multichannel.txt briefly notes how these modules form a  robust DSP library for software-defined radios.
