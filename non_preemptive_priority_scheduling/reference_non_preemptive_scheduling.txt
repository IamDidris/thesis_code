This file implements a non preemptive scheduling algorithm. Processes are stored in a linked list
where each node contains ID, arrival time, burst time, priority and calculated metrics such as 
completion time, waiting time and turnaround time. The program provides methods to insert, update 
or delete processes. During runtime, processes are selected based on arrival time, if multiple
processes have the same arrival time, the one with the highest priority is selected. The process
runs untill completion, then the next process is selected. The file also features a small test 
case.
