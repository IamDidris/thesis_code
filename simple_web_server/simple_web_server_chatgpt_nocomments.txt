The provided code is a simple C program that performs an HTTP GET request to retrieve data from a given URL. It works across both Windows and UNIX-like systems using platform-specific socket headers and macros defined in chap06.h.

At a high level, the program begins by parsing the input URL into components—protocol, hostname, port, and path—using the parse_url function. It only supports the HTTP protocol. It then uses the connect_to_host function to establish a TCP connection to the specified server using standard socket APIs and getaddrinfo.

Once connected, it sends a basic HTTP GET request using send_request, which formats and sends the necessary HTTP headers. The program then enters a loop to read the server’s response, handling different types of HTTP response encodings: content-length, chunked transfer, and connection-based termination.

It uses non-blocking select calls with a timeout to avoid hanging if the server is unresponsive. The response headers are parsed to determine how the body should be read. It then prints the response body to the console, either as a fixed-length payload, in chunks, or until the connection is closed.

The code is designed with basic error handling, timeout logic, and works within a buffer limit. Overall, it demonstrates a low-level, platform-independent HTTP client implementation using sockets in C.
