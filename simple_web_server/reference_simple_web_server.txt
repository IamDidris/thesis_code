The chap06.h file and web_get.c file provide a simple version 
of a GET request written in C utilizing BSD sockets or 
Winsock depending on the users platform. The header file 
features definitions of socket types, macros and error-handling
functions, making the file usable for both windows and unix
based devices. The source code is a command-line program that
receives a URL as argument and attempts to connect to the
specified host, defaulting to port 80 if not specified. 
The program attemps to resolve the hostname, create a socket 
and establish a connection to the remote server. 
After sending the request, the program waits for the data to arrive, 
then prints it out if successfull.
If the request times out or the connection closes, 
the program displays an error message before exiting.
