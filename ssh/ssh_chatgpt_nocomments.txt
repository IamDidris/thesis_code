The provided code files collectively implement various SSH functionalities using the libssh library. These are small C programs designed for specific tasks involving secure shell connections.  The ssh_version program simply retrieves and prints the current version of libssh being used. The ssh_connect file sets up a basic SSH connection to a specified host and port, displaying the connection banner and then closing the session. ssh_auth goes further by not only connecting but also performing server key verification, checking the serverâ€™s known-hosts status, and prompting the user for a password to authenticate.  The ssh_command program extends the authentication process by opening an SSH channel and allowing the user to input and execute a command remotely, then displaying the output. Similarly, ssh_download allows for authenticated file retrieval over SSH. It authenticates the user, requests a remote file using SCP, and prints its content to the terminal.  All these programs follow a common structure: parse command-line arguments, create and configure an SSH session, handle connection and authentication, perform the task (command execution or file download), and finally clean up the session. They rely heavily on interactive user input (e.g., passwords, command/file names), making them suitable for testing or demo purposes.  Overall, these files serve as practical examples or utilities for SSH operations using the libssh API, with each program dedicated to a specific SSH-related task.
