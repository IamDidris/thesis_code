Code Summary:
The provided C files implement functionalities for signal compression, expansion, and quantization, primarily for digital signal processing applications.

compand.c: This file implements μ-law (mu-law) compression and expansion functions for both real and complex numbers. These functions reduce the dynamic range of signals, a technique commonly used in audio and telecommunications to improve signal-to-noise ratio. The functions map input values logarithmically and then scale them based on a mu parameter.

quantizer.inline.c: Implements basic analog-to-digital (ADC) and digital-to-analog (DAC) quantization functions. The ADC function maps continuous values to discrete levels based on a specified number of bits, while the DAC function reconstructs the original values from the quantized samples. These are essential operations in digital communication and signal processing.

quantizer.proto.c: Defines a structured quantizer with configurable parameters, including the number of bits and companding method (e.g., linear, μ-law, A-law). It provides functions to create, destroy, and print quantizer objects, as well as to perform ADC and DAC operations using structured quantization.

quantizercf.c & quantizerf.c: Implement quantization APIs specifically for complex floating-point (quantizercf.c) and real floating-point (quantizerf.c) signals. They extend the structured quantizer prototype by defining the appropriate data types and linking to the corresponding implementation files.

Overall, these files together provide a flexible quantization framework, enabling various signal companding and quantization techniques for both real and complex signals in digital signal processing applications.
