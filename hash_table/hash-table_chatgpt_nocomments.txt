The provided code implements a hash table (or hash map) in C, a data structure used for efficient key-value storage and retrieval.  It consists of two main files: a header file (hash-table.h) and an implementation file (hash-table.c).   Overview: The hash table uses an array of linked lists (chaining) to handle collisions, ensuring efficient lookups and insertions.  The table dynamically resizes by selecting prime-sized buckets when necessary.   Key Features: Structure Definition:  _HashTableEntry stores key-value pairs with a pointer to the next entry for chaining.  _HashTable maintains an array of these entries, along with function pointers for hashing, comparison, and optional memory cleanup.  _HashTableIterator provides a way to iterate through stored elements.  Hash Table Operations:  hash_table_new(): Creates a new hash table, allocating an initial table size from a predefined list of prime numbers.  hash_table_insert(): Inserts or updates key-value pairs, resizing if necessary.  hash_table_lookup(): Retrieves values based on keys. hash_table_remove(): Deletes an entry and frees memory accordingly.  hash_table_iterate(): Supports iteration over elements. hash_table_free(): Cleans up memory.  The implementation focuses on efficiency, supporting dynamic resizing and flexible key-value storage through function pointers  for hashing and equality comparison.
