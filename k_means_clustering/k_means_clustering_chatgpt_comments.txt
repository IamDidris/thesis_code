The provided C program implements the K-Means Clustering Algorithm, a popular unsupervised machine learning technique for grouping data points into clusters. The code is designed to work with 2D data points and visualizes the clustering results in an EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) format.

Overview of Functionality:
Data Representation:

Uses observation struct to store 2D points with x, y coordinates and a cluster assignment.
Defines cluster struct to store centroid coordinates and the number of points assigned to it.
K-Means Algorithm Implementation:

Initialization: Assigns random initial clusters to observations.
Centroid Calculation: Computes the average position of points in each cluster.
Cluster Assignment: Reassigns each point to the closest centroid.
Iteration: Repeats until the cluster assignments stabilize.
Handles cases where k (number of clusters) is greater than, less than, or equal to the number of data points.
Testing and Visualization:

Generates random circularly distributed test data.
Runs K-Means clustering on 100,000 and 1,000,000 data points.
Uses printEPS() to output the results in a format suitable for graphical representation.
Key Takeaways:
The program is efficient for handling large datasets.
Designed for polar-distributed data but can be modified for general cases.
Uses random initialization and iterative refinement for clustering.
This implementation is inspired by Rosetta Code and follows best practices in clustering visualization.
