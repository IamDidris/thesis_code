This file implements a simpler version of the K-means clustering algorithm, typically used for
organizing data into clusters. This version is implemented for two-dimensional points. 
The algorithm assigns each point to the nearest centroid, then updates the centroids based on the 
assigned points, then repeats untill no significant changes have occured. 
The file also features some test files and a simple visualization of the clustering process.
