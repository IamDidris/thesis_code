This codebase appears to implement a basic compiler or interpreter system, including lexical analysis, parsing, and symbol table management.   Driver (driver.c) This is the main entry point of the program.  It calls the parser() function, which attempts to parse an input program and prints whether parsing was successful or not.   Token and Keyword Table (keytoktab.c, keytoktab.h) These files define a mapping between keywords, symbols, and their respective token values.  Functions convert lexemes (words in the source code) into tokens, lookup keywords, and translate tokens back into lexemes.   Lexer (lexer.c) This file implements lexical analysis.  It reads an input source program into a buffer, skips whitespace, and categorizes lexemes into tokens (identifiers, numbers, operators, etc.).  The get_token() function is the core, extracting tokens according to predefined rules.   Operator Table (optab.c) This file defines supported operators (+, *, etc.) and their operand/result type relationships.  It provides functions for retrieving the result type of an operation.  Parser (parser.c, parser.h) This is the heart of syntax analysis.  It implements recursive descent parsing for a simple programming language.  Functions analyze program structure, declarations, expressions, and statements, ensuring correct syntax and type consistency.   Symbol Table (symtab.c) This module stores and manages declared variables and their properties (name, type, size, memory address).  It supports functions for adding, looking up, and retrieving variable types.   Overall, this codebase forms a basic compiler front-end, handling lexical analysis, parsing, and symbol management.
