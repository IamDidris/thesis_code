The provided code files implement a simple compiler or interpreter-like system, handling lexical analysis, parsing, symbol tables, and operator tables.  Driver (no_comments_driver.c):  This serves as the entry point for the program. It calls the parser() function and prints whether parsing was successful or not. Key-Token Table (no_comments_keytoktab.c & no_comments_keytoktab.h):  Defines keywords and tokens used in the language. Provides functions to map between textual representations of tokens and their internal representations. Supports functions like lex2tok (lexeme to token), key2tok (keyword to token), and tok2lex (token to lexeme). Lexer (no_comments_lexer.c):  Handles lexical analysis by reading input text and breaking it into tokens. Uses a buffer to store the program text and provides a get_token function to fetch the next token. Recognizes numbers, identifiers, and symbols. Operator Table (no_comments_optab.c):  Defines a table of valid operations and their types. Provides get_otype to retrieve result types based on operands. Parser (no_comments_parser.c & no_comments_parser.h):  Implements syntax analysis by checking if the input follows the expected grammar. Uses functions like match to verify expected tokens. Calls different parsing routines for headers, variable declarations, and statements. Symbol Table (no_comments_symtab.c):  Manages variables and their attributes like type, size, and memory address. Provides functions for adding, searching, and setting types for variables. Overall, this system appears to be a simple interpreter or compiler front-end that processes a source code file, tokenizes it, verifies its syntax, and maintains symbol information for variables and operations.
