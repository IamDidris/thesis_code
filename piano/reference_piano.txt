The piano.c file contains a emulation of a piano, utilizing the PortAudio library for output and 
the X11 library for capturing keyboard events. The program loads 16bit stereo wav files and 
initializes them to correspond with each note on the piano. Each note can be both pressed or 
released, the notes transition between a "pressed state" and "fading state" where volume gradually
lowers over time. The program features a graphical interface where the pressed notes are displayed,
the user is also able to shift octaves utilzing the shift or control key. The notes played are 
mixed in an output buffer, allowing notes to play simultaniously without overloading.
