The provided C program implements a simple Bus Reservation System that allows users to log in, book tickets, cancel tickets, and check bus statuses. The program uses two main structures: Bus to store bus-related information (like bus number, source, destination, total seats, available seats, and fare) and User to store login credentials (username and password).  The program starts by displaying a main menu where users can either log in or exit. Upon successful login, the user is presented with a user menu offering options to book or cancel tickets, check bus status, or log out. The login functionality verifies user credentials against a predefined list of users.  For booking tickets, the user selects a bus by its number and specifies the number of seats to book. The program checks seat availability and updates the available seats accordingly. Similarly, for canceling tickets, the user specifies the bus number and the number of seats to cancel, and the program ensures that the cancellation does not exceed the booked seats. The bus status option allows users to view details of a specific bus, including its source, destination, total seats, available seats, and fare.  The program runs in a loop, continuously displaying menus and processing user inputs until the user chooses to exit. It manages user sessions by tracking the logged-in user and provides basic error handling for invalid inputs or operations. Overall, the program is a straightforward implementation of a bus reservation system with essential functionalities for user interaction and bus management.
