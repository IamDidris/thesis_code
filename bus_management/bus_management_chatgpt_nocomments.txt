This C program implements a simple bus ticket management system. It allows users to log in, book tickets, cancel reservations, and check bus status.

The program defines two structures: Bus, which stores details about buses such as bus number, source, destination, total and available seats, and fare, and User, which holds login credentials.

The main menu offers two options: login or exit. Users must log in using predefined credentials. Once authenticated, they access the user menu, which provides options to book a ticket, cancel a ticket, check bus status, or log out.

The ticket booking function allows users to select a bus by its number and specify the number of seats they want to book. If enough seats are available, the booking is confirmed, and the available seats are updated accordingly.

The cancellation function allows users to cancel previously booked tickets by entering the bus number and the number of seats to cancel. It ensures that users do not cancel more seats than were originally booked.

The bus status function displays details of a selected bus, including route, total seats, available seats, and fare.

The program runs in a loop, allowing multiple users to log in and perform operations until they choose to exit. It provides a basic command-line interface and uses simple condition checks to manage user actions and enforce constraints on booking and cancellations.
