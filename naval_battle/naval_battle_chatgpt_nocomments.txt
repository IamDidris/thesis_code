This C program is a two-player text-based implementation of the classic game Battleship. The game operates on a 10x10 grid for each player, where they strategically place boats of varying sizes and take turns attempting to sink each other’s fleet.  At the beginning, each player is prompted to position boats of three sizes—1, 2, and 3 units long—in specific quantities (6, 4, and 2 respectively). Boat placement is validated for proper orientation (horizontal or vertical), space availability, and boundary limits. A surrounding buffer zone is marked to prevent overlapping or adjacent boat placement.  Gameplay consists of up to 40 alternating turns where each player selects a grid coordinate to fire upon. The code checks if the shot is valid, updates the grid accordingly, and determines whether a boat has been fully sunk. Scoring is based on successful hits and completed boat eliminations, with different point values depending on boat size.  The game logic includes utility functions for board visualization, input validation, hit/miss handling, and score tracking. It ends by displaying the final score and declaring the game over.  Overall, the program emphasizes structured gameplay flow, input feedback, and grid-based visual output, encapsulating a complete, console-based Battleship experience.
